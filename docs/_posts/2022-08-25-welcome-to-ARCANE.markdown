##Why Arcane?


I needed a place to collect my thoughts and studies and make them available for free to anyone interested. In my Ph.D. journey, I am learning a lot of new and cool stuff concerning state-of-the-art AI technologies. I found a magical world capable of surprising you every time. The mystery behind the neural network, the exciting applications, everything there cooperates to mix reality with a dream. 


##Ok, but why?


On one of my first days at the University, I remember a Prof of mine who kept this captivating and motivating speech. At a certain point, he spoke about big open problems that informatic was addressing in that period (2014/2015). He talked about the unresolvable problem of protein folding prediction and the scarcity of hope at that time. Thus, protein folds, we don't know how, knowing it would be fundamental to unlock their life-supporting functions or dysfunction.
Less than ten years later (OMG, I am so old), AI solved the problem with the famous model AlphaFold 2 [1], published in Nature and produced by DeepMind. The scientific world (me too) was shocked. The most significant achievement in AI ever, Forbes said (https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2021/10/03/alphafold-is-the-most-important-achievement-in-ai-ever/).
I remember I thought: "This is magic." And like many dreamers still waiting for Hogwart's invitation, I decided to join this magical world of AI and descend into its arcane knowledge. 
Arcane was born from believing that knowledge should be free and available, so I want to do my little part to help others get comfortable with AI by sharing the little I have.


I don't know how I am going to organize the blog yet, but something will happen!!


See you soon!
