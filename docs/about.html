<p> Hi guys!! I am Lorenzo Valgimigli, a Ph.D. student with a great passion for AI.
I have a master's degree in Engineering and Computer Science, with a master's thesis on job recommendation systems based on novel transformer models.
I love many aspects of informatics, from security and ethical hacking to data science. 
During my Ph.D. I study original summarization approaches using neural networks. I work with Information Retrieval systems under low-resource and self-supervised settings. Despite my specific research fields, I love wandering into different domains to expand my knowledge.
I am a curious person with a creative and imaginative mind; I love riddles, chess, and a bit of physic.
I have collected a lot of topics I want to tell to who wish to learn about, so I decided to open this blog ( like pro researchers :) ) and start this new experience.
Well, be ready and enjoy!
</p>
